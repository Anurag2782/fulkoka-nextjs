At Fulkoka, we firmly believe in the power of education as a catalyst for positive change. Education is not just about acquiring knowledge; it is about unlocking opportunities, fostering creativity, and nurturing empathy. By promoting education, we aim to address the root causes of poverty, improve health outcomes, and preserve our precious environment and climate for future generations.

We recognize that health is not merely the absence of disease, but a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. In today's world, the challenges to our health are manifold, ranging from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) to mental health issues and the impacts of climate change. Our Health Initiative is dedicated to addressing these interconnected challenges and promoting holistic well-being for all.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)—such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions—are the leading causes of death globally, accounting for over 70% of all deaths. 
While traditional risk factors like unhealthy diets, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity are widely recognized, an equally critical but often overlooked aspect is the commercial determinants of health (CDOH). These determinants refer to the strategies and practices of private sector entities that influence health outcomes, often to the detriment of public health.
